            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Marc Engle, I am a former truck driver.<br>
               I worked at UPS for 5 years.  I gained very valuable<br>
               experience, that I will forever cherish, during my<br>
               time over there.  However, it was not something that I<br>
               could see myself doing for the rest of my life.  The<br>
               schedule combined with the lack of consistency<br>
               are the two biggest reasons I chose to leave<br>
               UPS.  Coding is something I have always wanted to<br>
               study, but I never went to school.  Wrongfully, I<br>
               assumed coding was something you need a degree for.<br>
               Once I figured out coding bootcamps were a thing<br>
               a thing, I knew I was going to make my way into one<br>
               sooner or later.  When my signifiacant other got her<br>
               new job, everything fell into place for me to have<br>
               the perfect opportunity to try something new. So,<br>
               here I am.

                <p style="text-indent: 5vh;">              
                 There are many hobbies and games that interest me.  Some of my
                 favorite hobbies include golf, video games, building legos,
                 and going out to eat.  I have two favorite tv shows and I rank
                 them together as equals.  My favorite comedy is The Office.  My
                 favorite crime/drama show is Dexter.  They are both great shows
                 and I definitely could not pick one over the other.  My favorite
                 food is macaroni and cheese.

                <h2>UPS Experience</h2>
                <p style="text-indent: 5vh;">              
                 I wanted to take this section to talk more specifically about my
                 time at UPS.  During my time at UPS I worked in their warehouse 
                 as a forklift operator with the Freight Division.  After a year
                 of that I transferred to their small package division and worked in 
                 the warehouse unloading trucks by hand for just over a year.  Luckily
                 an opportunity for me to become a truck driver opened up and I was able 
                 to make it through the 2 week training period.  This was one of the 
                 toughest challenges I faced.  I drove trucks for them for 3 years and 
                 it was such an amazing experience.  I was able to see different parts
                 of the Southeast region driving trucks 5 days a week.  Yet, I was 
                 still able to sleep in my bed every night.  That is not something
                 most truck drivers have the luxury of.  If I had to go back I 
                 would do it all over again.  However, given where I want to be in
                 the future, I knew my time there would not last forever.
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 5vh;">
                 UPS has taught me many skills that will be useful for my time
                 at Coding Temple, as well as my future web development career.
                 While there, I learned how to work well under pressure.  I'm
                 also used to working very long hours at all periods of the night
                 or day.  Given how tight some deadlines can be while coding, being
                 used to working long hours while under pressure will be beneficial.
                 I can't wait to see how the skills learned from UPS transfer into
                 a software engineer's world.
